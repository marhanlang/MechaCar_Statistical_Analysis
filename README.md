Vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.

The slope of the linear model is not equal to zero because the P value is less than the significance level (0.05).

The linear model is functional, but could be improved. The intercept is statisticallly significant. A significant intercept could mean that the significant variables (vehicle length and ground clearance) may need scaling or transforming to avoid over-fitting and improve predictive power of the linear model.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

![Lot Summary](https://github.com/marhanlang/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Images/lot_summary.png)

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. 
Based on the current manufacturing data, lots one, two, and total variance meet the design specifications, but lot three exceeds the specifications for variance with a varience of 170.29.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

![T-Test 3](https://github.com/marhanlang/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Images/t_testL3.png)

There is no statistical difference in PSI in lots one and two and overal from the population mean of 1,500 PSI. Lot 3 is the only lot where the p-value is not above the assumed significance level of 0.05.

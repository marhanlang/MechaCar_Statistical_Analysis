Vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.

The slope of the linear model is not equal to zero because the P value is less than the significance level (0.05).

The linear model is functional, but could be improved. The intercept is statisticallly significant. A significant intercept could mean that the significant variables (vehicle length and ground clearance) may need scaling or transforming to avoid over-fitting and improve predictive power of the linear model.
